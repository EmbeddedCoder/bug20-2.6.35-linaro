Bug Video Module (aka bmi_video)

Bug Module Supported: BugVideo 2.0 Hardware Module
Bug Base Supported: BugBase 2.0a (aka BugBase YT)
Kernel Supported:  Linux Kernel 2.6.35


Overview:
This folder contains kernel module code (bmi_video_core) that runs to load 
VGA/DVI monitor support into the kernel. This allows the BugVideo module to 
output video when it is plugged in.

This code relies on the general bmi plug/unplug support, as well as several
framebuffer and omap2 specific video drivers.

Behavior:
This kernel module is loaded on boot if a module is detected, or manually loaded and 
unloaded by a user. When loaded, it registers with the BMI plug-in system, but does not 
enable any features. When a BugVideo module is plugged in bmi_video_probe is called, and
video is enabld. When the module is unplugged bmi_video_remove is called, and video 
is disabled.

Userspace Interface:
This module can be accessed via sysfs in /sys/bus/bmi/devices/<DEVICE_ID>. It provides
one read/write file 'vmode'. Reading from vmode displays a list of what mode the module
has, with the current mode in brackets. For example ' OFF [VGA] DVI AUTO' indicates the
driver is in VGA mode. OFF indicates no video mode is enabled, or that there is an error.
AUTO is a temporary state that auto-changes to VGA/DVI/OFF based on monitor sensing.

Writing 'auto','off','vga', or 'dva' to the vmode file will change video modes. Off disables video, Auto will run auto-detect and pick the best mode to use (DVI if both DVI and VGA are connected), or change to off if no monitor is detected. 

Phyiscal Interface:
BugVideo has a single two-color LED on it. The three LED states are:
OFF: BugVideo detected a Monitor, did setup, and the monitor should be running OK

RED: BugVideo has a problem, either during boot or during chaning modes. Look at the logs

GREEN: BugVideo is up and running, but has detected no monitors attached. Attach a monitor
 	and send 'auto' to the vmode file in sysfs to auto-detect a monitor.
